	<h1>Welcome To My First Website</h1>
	<h3>Hello, friends!</h3>
	<p>The website you are currently viewing is a project site and is not intended to be taken seriously (you probably figured that out already). To be honest, I don't really know where I'm going with this. This web page is going to consist mostly of filler text and maybe an image or two. Prepare to be underwhelmed!</p>
	<h3>What Can You Expect To Find Here?</h3>
	<p>Nothing really. This web page is a work in progress.</p>
